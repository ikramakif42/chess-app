# Chess App (test)

Personal project to tinker around with Python and get a super simple Chess app going. Work-in-progress, who knows how this will go!

**Goals:**
- Use FEN to load states ✅
- Functional CLI ✅
- Lists for board representation ✅
- Making valid moves
- Evaluation on the basis of material, maybe add mobility
- NegaMax with pruning for search
- Functional GUI

**Additional avenues I want to explore down the line:**
- Improving performance (maybe switch to C/C++)
- Better evaluation of a given state
- Explore ML/DL for stronger predictions
- Try object-orientation
